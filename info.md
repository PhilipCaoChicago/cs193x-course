CS193X: Web Programming Fundamentals is a new course at Stanford University, created by Victoria Kirst in Spring 2017.

**Warning:** This is the very first offering of this course. It will not go perfectly. There will be last-minute schedule changes, mistakes in lecture, bugs in assignments, etc.

_If you are not OK with this_, please consider the taking the next offering of this course in the 2017-2018 school year.

## Content and grading
Each assignment will be graded **individually** and will be scored on both functionality and style. Check the course website frequently for new assignments and course announcements.

Grades will be calculated as follows:
- **Homework:** 60%
- **Mini-HWs:** 5%
- **Final Project:** 35%

**Mini-Homeworks** are multiple-choice quizzes you are asked to complete before starting the regular assignment. You can retry as many times as you want without penalty.

Regular **Homework** assignments will be distributed and turned in via Github Classroom.

There are no exams or quizzes in this course, meaning there is no midterm or final exam.

## Lateness policy
In general, homework is allowed to be submitted up to 48 hours after the deadline. Homework submitted on time will receive a small bonus to their homework score.

- Each homework writeup will indicate the deadline for on-time submission.
- Submitting by the deadline earns an on-time bonus, typically a ~5% perk.
- If you miss the deadline, there is a 48 hour grace period. You can make a late submission up to the end of the grace period. These late submissions are not penalized, but do not earn the on-time bonus.
- Submissions are **not accepted beyond the grace period**. The grace period is strictly enforced.

Note that the lateness policy only applies to homework. **The final project must be turned in on time** or it will not get credit.


## Honor code

The web is an unusual platform in that you can view the source code for every website that you visit. A common and encouraged way to improve your web programming skills is to view the source and inspect the code of interesting websites on the internet.

With that in mind, here are a few specific guidelines for viewing and sharing code in this class:

- You **may not** look at the source of a CS193X solution before turning in that assignment.
- You **may not** copy the source of someone else's CS193X solution and turn it in as your own.
- You **may** look at the source code of other websites for help when writing your homework solutions.
- You **may not** publish the homework you write in this class for the purpose of allowing other people to copy your code.
- You **may** publish the homework you write in this class for the purpose of showing off the web page itself.
- You **may** use StackOverflow, Mozilla Developer Network, etc as online resources for your homework.

All students are expected to follow the [honor code](https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/masters-handbook/honor-code), to act with integrity, and to "take an active part in seeing to it that others as well as themselves uphold the spirit and letter of the Honor Code." Contact the course staff with any questions.
