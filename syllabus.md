Here is the tentative syllabus for CS193X.

**This syllabus is subject to radical change**. Spring 2017 is the first time
CS193X is being offered, so we may need to make significant adjustments to the
schedule depending on a variety of factors.

This syllabus will be updated throughout the quarter, and generally speaking,
the further from present the topic is, the more likely it is to change.
